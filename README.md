Hello,

Probably one of my most complex projects to date. I learned about utlizing CSS variables along with JS to make some extremely fun and interactive inputs where you can modify an image. I also learned more about JS event listeners.

I plan to return to this project when I have more time. I want to implement a feature that involves the user being able to drag-and-drop an image to modify. If possible, I want the user to be able to download the modified image as well.

Instructions: Please locally host all the documents in the same directory. You can run a live server extension availiable on vscode.
